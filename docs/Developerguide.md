### Setting Up:
#### Prerequisites:
  * First of all you have to download Qt Creator from https://www.qt.io/download. 
  * **Important**: to download any version of Qt 5.4 or lower. This is because the orignal code written here https://github.com/yyjhao/IVLEDownloader uses QWebKit which is library used by Qt 5.4 or lower.
